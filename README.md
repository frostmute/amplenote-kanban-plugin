# Amplenote Plugin Embed Starter Project

This project provides a basic starting point for developing a
React-based application that can be rendered in an Amplenote
embed.

# Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, choosing a repo name appropriate to the plugin you will build.
2. `git clone` your forked repo, following GitHub's instructions
3. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
4. Create a build with `yarn build`

# Output

The output of the build step is a zip file containing a markdown note
that can be used as a plugin note in Amplenote. Import this zip file
as a markdown archive in Amplenote and enable it as a plugin in your 
Amplenote account. The zip file contains an attachment containing
the potentially-large plugin code, to avoid creating an extremely
large note.

The following plugin actions are implemented in the plugin:

- `appOption` triggering the plugin via the quick open menu will open a sidebar embed for the plugin
- `renderEmbed` handles rendering the sidebar embed, rendering this application in the sidebar
- `onEmbedCall` called when `window.callAmplenotePlugin` is called from the embed code in this project

The `renderEmbed` action output by this plugin can remain unchanged in the final plugin, but it's likely that the
`appOption` and `onEmbedCall` actions will need to be customized to fit the needs of the final plugin.

# Development

Run `yarn dev` to serve the application locally, with automatic reloading on filesystem changes.
